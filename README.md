NIP - Dynamic Bayesian Network library

This repo contains the code used in my MSc thesis:
http://users.ics.aalto.fi/jatoivol/di-oneside.pdf

There has been some revision to this software since the year 2007, though.

tl;dr: 
- (Dynamic) Bayesian Network (DBN) library in C
- categorical/discrete random variables -> probability tables
- (D)BN -> join tree transformation
- exact join tree inference (batch/offline mode)
- Expectation Maximization (EM) learning
- sampling from a given model
- some elementary command line tools, see demo.sh

[Smyth, Heckerman, Jordan 1996] used acronym PIN: probabilistic independence network (for BN), so I named this NIP
