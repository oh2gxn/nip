# Creates incomplete data by hiding part of the values 
# in a data file. Values are hidden randomly according to given observation
# probability for each variable. 
# 
# 100% means that all the samples are kept the way they are
#
# 0% means that the variable is entirely hidden and the variable is renamed
# with prefix "hidden_". Samples are kept intact.
#
# Negative observation probability causes the variable be completely hidden
# and left out of the output.
#
# Otherwise only some of the samples are hidden randomly 
# and designated with "null".
#
#
# Example: gawk -f hide_values.awk original_data.txt > partial_data.txt
#
# Janne Toivola, 28.04.2006
# - No special treatment for completely hidden variables: 09.10.2006
# - Drop completely hidden variables from the output: 11.11.2006
